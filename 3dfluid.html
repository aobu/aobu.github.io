                <p class="section-title">Extending Jos Stam's Fluid Simulation to Three Dimensions</p>
                <p>
                    I've recently revisited my <a href="https://alexisobu.com/fluidsim.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fluid sim</a>, extending it from two dimensions to three dimensions. Code at: <a href="https://github.com/aobu/FluidSim3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a>
                </p>
                
                <p class="section-title">Extending to 3D</p>
                <p>
                    The original 2D simulation solves the Navier-Stokes equations in a simplified, computationally feasible way.
                    Extending this to 3D was annoying but straightforward. Add another array to the directional values, edit the boundary conditions to handle a third dimension, and consider the extra neighbours for each cell when solving.
                    I've been writing a lot of C recently, so I wrote this in C too.
                </p>
                
                <p class="section-title">Numerical Methods</p>
                <p>
                    I rewrote the linear system solving logic using the Jacobi iteration method. The diffusion and pressure projection equations are solved by iteratively approximating a system of linear equations.
                    Since I was overhauling most of the code, and with plans to parallelize portions to boost performance and increase my grid resolution, I opted for the Jacobi method over Gauss-Seidel. The Jacobi algorithm updates each unknown based solely on values from the previous iteration, allowing for independent, parallel computation across the grid.
                    In contrast, Gauss-Seidel updates sequentially using the latest values, which creates dependencies and limits parallelism.

                <p class="section-title">Rendering: 2.5D</p>
                <p>
                    For rendering, I used a simple approach that still looks great. Since I was already comfortable rendering a grid of 2D cells, moving to 3D was as easy as stacking another dimension of these grids and rotating the camera to view them from the side.
                    Because I only render from a fixed camera angle, any edge artifacts are minimal when using a large grid.

                <p>
                    Experimenting with the fragment shaders produced some very nice results, particularly the fire shader and a GOT-style "wildfire" shader.
                    Despite several attempts at tweaking the viscosity and diffusion parameters, I couldn't get anything that looked convincingly like water.

                <p>
                    The current implementation handles a resolution of 50x50x50 (125,000 cells) quite well.
                    To push this further, I plan to explore GPU computation or multi-threading. Theres also some other small improvements to be made like early termination on the Jacobi solver.
